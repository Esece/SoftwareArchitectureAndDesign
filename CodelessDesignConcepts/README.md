# Codeless Design Concepts
There will be less "coding" in the future. As more and more components and modules become standardized and commoditized, most business problems will be solved simply by selecting the right components and designing a pipeline.
Must of the programming will be for designing generic algorithms and components.

### More Declarative Than Imperative
Declarative
``` xml
<appSettings>
  <add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" />
```

Imparative
``` csharp
HtmlHelper.ClientValidationEnabled = true;
```

Benefits of Being Declarative
- Focus on what it is instead of how it is done
- No need to care about control flow and execution order
- More human-readable

**This is already the case in much of frontend programming like HTML and CSS.**
