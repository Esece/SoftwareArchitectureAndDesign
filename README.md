# Software Architecture and Development

## Key Engineering Philosophies:
* Efficient
* Simple
* Extendable
* Composable
* Easy to Maintain

## Languages and Technologies Used:
C#, JavaScript, T-SQL, CSS, HTML, ASP.NET MVC, Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS

### Efficiency
##### Standardize processes, automate common, repeated tasks, and set and meet performance requirements

### Simple
##### Design easy-to-understand flows, write self-describing code, and keep scopes as small as possible

### Extendable
##### Build solid foundation to allow future enhancements with little or no modification to the existing design

### Composable
##### Create loosely coupled, independent modules to minimize dependency and side effects

### Ease of Maintenance
##### Avoid developer-assisted maintenance if at all possible and speed up troubleshooting and bug fixing
