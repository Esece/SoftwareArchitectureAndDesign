## Agile Software Development

#### Key to Successful Agile Development
* Good Communication
* Good Collaboration
* Fast and Efficient Planning to Release Cycle
* Working Software Designed for Frequent, Small Enhancements

#### Requirements are (almost) Dead
* Acceptance criteria are used for requirements
* A user story is created as a releasable piece
* Real data should be visible and easily accessible to business stakeholders, instead of refering to a document that is maintained separately
* Many test cases are created to maintain quality and anyone can view test results

#### Focus on Functionality and User Experience
* For defining functions, avoid using words like 'click,' 'ajax,' 'page,' 'database,' and any others that are technology terms
* Prefer using general words like 'select,' 'updates automatically,' 'order form,' and 'product master.'
* Try to define functions and user experience (UX) separately
* Flowcharts may be created to assist with development
* Mockups and wireframes may be used to define UI/UX needs

Example User Story
>As a user who forgot the password, I would like to provide my user name so that I can receive an email to reset my password.
