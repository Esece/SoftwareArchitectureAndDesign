## User Stories

#### One of the most common formats is "As a.., I would like to do... so that I can do..."

Examples:
* As a new user, I would like to create an sign-in account so that I can use the service.
* As an admin user, I would like to create readonly user accounts so that they can use the service with limited access.
* As a customer, I would like to use a Visa credit card so that I can complete my transaction.
* As a customer interested in purchasing a new sofa, I would like to see store availability information so that I can visit the store to take a look.
