## Managing Bugs

#### A bug ticket is created usually when there is a discrepancy between a requirement and an actual behavior

> Testing should be conducted based on the written acceptance criteria. If a critical issue is found during the testing period, the team will need to review new requirements before formally testing for a bug.
