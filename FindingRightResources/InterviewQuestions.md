## Issues with Interview Questions

### Facts
* So many companies ask questions that are just too academic or too impractical in their actual development environment.
* So many interviewers ask questions they cannot even answer correctly.
* So many questions lack context and yet expect generic solutions to the problems, when in real life, context plays a big role in decision making.

### Examples of Academic Questions
|Question|Issue|
|-----|-----|
|Is string a value type or reference type in C#?|Understanding how a string type is designed would be more useful.|
|What is the difference between Boxing and Unboxing?|The issue to discuss should be rather using the object type to store a value type. Still, the boxing cost is insignificant in many applications.|
