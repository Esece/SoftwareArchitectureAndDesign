## Finding Right Resources

### Types of Resources
|Type|For Employers|For Employees|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Fulltime|Generally can expect people to stay. Could be a lot of setup work at HR.|Comes with health insurance, 401k, employee-only events, etc. Possibly lower pay if you don't take advantage of company-sponsored benefits. The company generally cares about product quality. Your manager is generally technical or could be still hands-on.|
|Contract|Simple setup just like outsourcing. Most likely lower overall staff cost because of the lack of health insurance and paid vacation. You care more about getting things done than creating an environment or helping your people grow|Higher pay, may be able to bill hourly. You need to insure yourself. Employers may not renew your contract with no reason. You just want to get things done.|
|Contract to Hire|You can take time and see if the person fits in. No need to worry about company benefits until then. You can let the person go with no supporting documentation.|Very little advantage for employees. You should see it as a short-term contract role.|

  - "Translating" concepts and sketches to visual and interactive representation
  - Generally calling pre-defined functions to create processes
  - Good understanding of function/component usage but without understanding how things are actually implemented behind the scene.
* UX Designers
   - Using special software for mockups and user interaction like InVision and Axure
   - Designing 2D as well as interactive prototypes usually without coding
* Technical Architects
  - Good understanding of software architecture and design patterns and when and where to use them effectively

* QA Test Engineers
  - Use testing tools like Selenium
  - Write automation scripts

### Experience Levels
* Junior
  - Recently graduated with, typically, a computer science degree, occasionally other IT degrees like information systems.
  - Has 0-2 years of professional experience.
  - Needs some guidance or directions for getting tasks completed
  - In job interviews, candidates are typically expected to talk about their interests and personal software projects and to answer technical questions related to computer languages and algorithms. Good candidates show enthusiasm about building software in real life and tend to focus on using new technologies, good or bad.
* Mid-Level
  - Has 2+ years of experience or has an master's degree in computer science with sometimes math and engineering as well
  - Has been professionally coding with a variety of languages, frameworks, and technologies
  - Can complete tasks on his or her own with or without good practices
  - May not be able to understand how an entire application works even in a small project
  - In job interviews, candidates are expected to talk about the applications or projects they worked on and the tools you have used.
* Senior
  - 5+ years of experience
  - Familar with best practices and knows when to use and when not to use certain patterns, tools, and technologies
  - Can start a software project from the ground up.
  - Has good interpersonal skills and can work with less experienced engineers to provide help or guidance
  - In job interviews, candidates are expected to talk about problems and solutions
* Lead
  - 8+ years of experience
  - Has been coding and also leading software projects and feature implementation
  - Works with non-technical individuals and report development status effectively
  - Conducts technical screening and interviews
  - In job interviews, candidates are expected to talk about full-stack development and leadership experience 
* Architect
  - 10+ years of experience
  - In job interviews, candidates are expected to talk about a wide range of tools and services like cloud technologies, analytics tools, logging, caching, and security.

> Good software engineers can build developer tools for their own and their peers. 

> Average software engineers tend to go for newer technologies without understanding of how they can solve existing problems.

### Types of Skills
|Type|Where it's Effective|What to Watch Out|Remarks|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Good Communication|Others can understand you. You can get your ways through better especially|Sometimes there is just more talking than taking action. Being able to speak well does not always mean being able to write (or code) effectively.|It's one of the most listed qualifications. Yet it's not so easy to assess. Sometimes it's about chemistry, and sometimes it's about whether someone speaks good English as a second language. After all, do you even need to list it as a requirement..?|

### Embracing Diversity
> It may be one way to form a team with people that have similar skills, but you can also form a highly productive team with diversity. At the end, everyone is different, so why expect them to be the same..? Regardless, as a hiring manager, you should mention your expectations to potential employees.

### Software Engineers - Difference between Good Ones and Bad Ones

|Good|Bad|Remarks|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Convert data to the right type as soon as it is read|Convert data when and where it is used|Unconverted data can be of string or object type|
|Serialize data when there is no more operation of it|Serialize data too early causing deserialization down the process||
|Write a fewer lines of code|Write more lines of code|The difference is often 1:3+|
|Define a fewer variables|Define more variables||
|Know what exceptions to catch and handle|Catch all exceptions at once||
|Use 'Dictionary' for lookup operations|Use switch statements for lookup operations||
|Use empty lines to separate logical groups|Eliminate empty lines to fit more code.||
|Break up a long statement into small, multiple statements in separate lines|Word-wrap a long statement||
|Define classes for different types of operations|Use #region tags to group different operations within a single class||
|Use a meaningful variable name such as 'firstName.'|Use a short, cryptic name such as 'fn.'|| 
|Avoid static objects and stateful static methods (C#)|Use static objects and stateful static methods for convenience||
|Use a string type for US Zip Codes|Use an interger type for US Zip Codes||
|Keep a lambda expression short (C#)|Write a long, multi-line lambda expression (C#)||
|Return an object for returning multiple values from a method (C#)|Use 'out' parameters to return multiple values from a method (C#)||
|Use 'Tuple' objects to store and pass values within a variable or a class|Use 'Type' as a return type of a public method||
