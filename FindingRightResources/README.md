## Finding Right Resources

### Types of Resources
|Type|For Employers|For Employees|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Fulltime|Generally can expect people to stay. Could be a lot of setup work at HR.|Comes with health insurance, 401k, employee-only events, etc. Possibly lower pay if you don't take advantage of company-sponsored benefits. The company generally cares about product quality. Your manager is generally technical or could be still hands-on.|
|Contract|Simple setup just like outsourcing. Most likely lower overall staff cost because of the lack of health insurance and paid vacation. You care more about getting things done than creating an environment or helping your people grow|Higher pay, may be able to bill hourly. You need to insure yourself. Employers may not renew your contract with no reason. You just want to get things done.|
|Contract to Hire|You can take time and see if the person fits in. No need to worry about company benefits until then. You can let the person go with no supporting documentation.|Very little advantage for employees. You should see it as a short-term contract role.|

### Types of Skills
|Type|Where it's Effective|What to Watch Out|Remarks|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Good Communication|Others can understand you. You can get your ways through better especially|Sometimes there is just more talking than taking action. Being able to speak well does not always mean being able to write (or code) effectively.|It's one of the most listed qualifications. Yet it's not so easy to assess. Sometimes it's about chemistry, and sometimes it's about whether someone speaks good English as a second language. After all, do you even need to list it as a requirement..?|

> It may be one way to form a team with people that have similar skills, but you can also form a highly productive team with diversity. At the end, everyone is different, so why expect them to be the same..? Regardless, as a hiring manager, you should mention your expectations to potential employees.
