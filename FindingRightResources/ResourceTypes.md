### Types of Resources
|Type|For Employers|For Employees|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Fulltime|Generally can expect people to stay. Could be a lot of setup work at HR.|Comes with health insurance, 401k, employee-only events, etc. Possibly lower pay if you don't take advantage of company-sponsored benefits. The company generally cares about product quality. Your manager is generally technical or could be still hands-on.|
|Contract|Simple setup just like outsourcing. Most likely lower overall staff cost because of the lack of health insurance and paid vacation. You care more about getting things done than creating an environment or helping your people grow|Higher pay, may be able to bill hourly. You need to insure yourself. Employers may not renew your contract with no reason. You just want to get things done.|
|Contract to Hire|You can take time and see if the person fits in. No need to worry about company benefits until then. You can let the person go with no supporting documentation.|Very little advantage for employees. You should see it as a short-term contract role.|
