Being able to speak well does not always mean being able to write (or code) effectively.|It's one of the most listed qualifications. Yet it's not so easy to assess.

### Embracing Diversity
> It may be one way to form a team with people that have similar skills, but you can also form a highly productive team with diversity. At the end, everyone is different, so why expect them to be the same..? Regardless, as a hiring manager, you should mention your expectations to potential employees.
